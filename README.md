# <h2> Introduction: 
My name is Samantha Guerrero. I was born and raised in LA County, specifically living in the Eastside cities such as Montebello, East LA, and Pico Rivera. 
# <h2> UP 206A: Introduction to GIS
Based on this course's description, the goal of this course is to familiarize students with use of geographic data in public policy, urban planning, and related practice, and develop skill base for community practice that provides each student with tools necessary to organize and plan effectively for political, economic, and social justice in our communities.(CCLE). 
My goal of this course as an urban planning student is to learn the coding and mapping skills *as well as* learn how to apply these skills in projects and other tasks that are applicable to the real world. 
## <h2> Interests in Urban Planning
 1. Economic development
 1. Community development/ Community power
 1. Water issues
 1. Access to healthy food
# <h2> Data Science Project Space: 
I am interested in analyzing access to healthy food markets (or **lack of**), especially by comparing this to income levels within a community. üçã ü•© ü•¨ üçó üßÖ
 For example, growing up on the Eastside, I never knew about Trader Joe's, or Sprout's. We mainly had family-owned markets, or the lower-quality markets of bigger food companies. I want to use data science, especially GIS, to create a map that visualizes the proximity of food access and income levels. The goal of this project is to prove how markets with high-quality products have a preferred consumer profile compared to other markets with lower-quality products that are placed in low-income areas that tailor to BIPOC.
